# Summary
[Keel](https://github.com/keel-hq/keel) is a tool for automatically updating the images used by pods. It handles any image that isn't managed via Helm. Every **2 hours**, Keel will check for updated images for all monitored apps. If an update is found, Keel will delete the pod, which should trigger a pull of the newer image. This assumes `imagePullPolicy: Always`. 

For a pod to be monitored by Keel, it requires the following annotations:
```
metadata:
  annotations:
    keel.sh/policy: force
    keel.sh/match-tag: "true"
    keel.sh/trigger: poll
```
# Notifications
Notifications about upgrades are sent to email and Slack.

Slack app config is pulled from https://github.com/keel-hq/keel/issues/491#issuecomment-1022326010

Here is an overview of how to create a new style app for Slack.

1. Login to your Slack workspace on the web and go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Create New App
3. Choose "From an app manifest"
4. Pick a workspace to develop your app in. <-- your choice
5. In the app manifest window, change "Demo App" to "Keel App" and click next
6. Now hit create (no i don't know why its an extra step either! )
7. Choose "OAuth & Permissions" from the left hand menu - in the Features section
8. Scroll down to "Bot Token Scopes" and add "channels:read", "chat:write" and "users:read"
9. Now scroll up, and "Install to Workspace"
10. It will now ask for permissions, click allow
11. On the next page you will now have a Bot User OAuth Token - add this to your Keel configs
      The trick here is that your bot name is "keel_app" if you used two words.
        - name: SLACK_TOKEN

# Summary
[External DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) automates the creation/deletion of DNS records in [AdGuard Home](/manifests/adguard). When a new `HTTPRoute` is added to an application, a DNS record is created in AdGuard Home with the value from `spec.hostnames`. It uses the [AdGuard External DNS Provider](https://github.com/muhlba91/external-dns-provider-adguard/pkgs/container/external-dns-provider-adguard). If the `HTTPRoute` is removed, the DNS record is removed as well.

# Summary
This is a locally-hosted container registry for hosting private images that aren't posted on DockerHub.

All data is stored on the NAS under `/share/appdata/vol/registry`. 

DockerFiles required for building the images are located on the [Docker](https://github.com/kenlasko/docker) repository.
